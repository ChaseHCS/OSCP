For websites good to run some inital enum scripts before looking for more in-depth vulns.

1. HTTP Headers - Tells you about the sites tech stack

curl -I http://<IP>

2.  NMAP scripts - More info on tech stack

nmap -p 80,443 -sV --script http-title,http-headers <IP>

3. Feroxbuster - brute force subdirectories

4. FFUF - brute force subdomains

 ffuf -u http://<ip> -H "Host: FUZZ.forest.htb" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -mc all -ac
