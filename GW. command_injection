If a website allows commands to be entered, try command injection.

1. Open POST in burpsuite. Look for where the command is located in the POST.

2. Find out where the filter is since it is likely filtered to only one command.

3. Attempt using a encoded delimiter such as "%3B" to add a new cmd. For ex, "git%3Bifconfig"

4. The following cmd can tell us if the code is running in cmd or pwsh. (dir 2>&1 *`|echo CMD);&<# rem #>echo PowerShell

5. Next run any cmd you please.
