PRE-SCANNING ACTIVITIES

echo "10.10.10.4 legacy.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts == Add IP to hosts files to make enum more easy.

PORT SCANNING

Basic portscanning methodology is to do a light scan of everyport on machine or network first. Then continue with an aggressive scan on the open ports.

autorecon == Runs both the light scan then the aggressive scan automatically. Highly effecient. Highly effective // https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon


ports=$(nmap -Pn -p- --min-rate=10000 10.10.10.182 | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)
nmap -p$ports -Pn -sC -sV 10.10.10.182 == Nice little two liner that does the broad scan then the aggressive scan.

LIGHT BROAD SCANNING TOOLS

rustscan -a <Target IP> == Scans all 65k ports in 3 seconds. // https://github.com/bee-san/RustScan

masscan -p1-65535 <target-ip> --rate=1000 -e tun0 == Another fast but older scanner // https://github.com/zan8in/masscan

scanless -s all <target-ip> == anonymous port scanner // 

naabu == fast and lightweight port scanner written in go // https://github.com/projectdiscovery/naabu

AGGRESSIVE TARGETED SCANNING TOOLS

nmap -sC --script vuln -sV -p (port,port,ports) <10.10.10.3>

SERVICE EXPLOIT SEARCHING

searchsploit 'Exploit name' 'Exploit version' == Looks for known exploits downloaded on Kali.
