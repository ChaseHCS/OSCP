Here's a step-by-step guide to set up the BloodHound GUI on Kali Linux or any other Debian-based distro.

🛠️ 1. Install Dependencies
You need Neo4j (database backend) and BloodHound GUI (frontend).

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bloodhound
This will install both Neo4j and BloodHound.

🧱 2. Start the Neo4j Database
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo neo4j console
Default port: 7474

Default username/password: neo4j / neo4j

You'll be prompted to set a new password the first time.

Keep this terminal open while using BloodHound.

🧠 3. Launch BloodHound GUI
In a new terminal, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
bloodhound
Connect to bolt://localhost:7687

Use the username: neo4j

Use the password you set earlier

📤 4. Import BloodHound-python Output
Click the upload icon in the top right corner of BloodHound

Select your .json files (from BloodHound-python output)

BloodHound will ingest and analyze the data

🔎 5. Use Built-in Queries
Once data is loaded, use prebuilt queries like:

"Shortest path to domain admin"

"Users with admin rights on computers"

"Kerberoastable accounts"

You can also use Cypher queries to build your own analysis paths.

Let me know if you want a cheat sheet of Cypher queries or if you run into any issues with Neo4j startup.
