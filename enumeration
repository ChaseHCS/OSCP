PORT SCANNING

Basic portscanning methodology is to do a light scan of everyport on machine or network first. Then continue with an aggressive scan on the open ports.

LIGHT BROAD SCANNING TOOLS

rustscan -a <Target IP> == Scans all 65k ports in 3 seconds.

AGGRESSIVE TARGETED SCANNING TOOLS

nmap -sC -sV -p (port,port,ports) <10.10.10.3>

SERVICE EXPLOIT SEARCHING

searchsploit 'Exploit name' 'Exploit version' == Looks for known exploits downloaded on Kali.
